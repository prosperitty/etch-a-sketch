## Etch A Sketch

### Overview

This project was created using javascript with a focus on DOM manipulation.

### How It Works:

 On the grid provided, the user may hover over the grid with the cursor to create a pixelated trail. The user may change the amount of boxes in the grid by clicking the reset button and providing a number from 16 to 64. This input will create a new grid dimension ranging from 16x16 to 64x64. The option to create a trail of random colors is included.
